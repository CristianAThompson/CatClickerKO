###This is an example of how to utilize different aspects of KnockoutJS to build a simple webapp

Based on a repo with img data and HTML template.
Using KOJS(KnockoutJS) we have the ability to greatly simplify our code in building a cat clicker website.

To use the Cat Clicker web app simply click the image of the cat to increase the counter and increase your level. It's that simple.

Hope you enjoy the cats. Click and stay awhile.
